This is a test post from my android phone, made with [Mr. Hyde](http://faudroids.org/MrHyde/).
The app lets you publish Jekyll posts from your phone, via a minimalistic ui and without any technical experience (it is definitely *way* easier to use then my usual git routine on the computer).

Beware thought: it only works if your site is published in the repositories master-branch. It cost me more then 3h to get this figured out, as documentation on the app is pretty limited afaik.
