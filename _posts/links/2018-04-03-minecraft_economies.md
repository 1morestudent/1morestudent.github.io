Alice Maz writes about her [experiences as minecraft-tycoon](https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/minecraft.html#). A somewhat etrange essay whose take-away message seems to be that you can cheat the economy of an online game easier then that of the real world. I started it with only a mediocre interested but went all the way through and was fascinated in the end, even thought I don't know if I learned anything new. You don't need to know minecraft to enjoy this.
