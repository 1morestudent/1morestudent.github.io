Scott Alexander posted [a good reason why you should not trust old studies that never got replicated](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/02/are-the-amish-unhappy-super-happy-just-meh/). It's his take on the question "Are the Amish more happy then other people" (read: is traditional life better). Turns out that the answer is "we don't really know" and that everyone doing research on this is named "Diener".
