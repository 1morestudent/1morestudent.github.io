Spaceships as closed eco-systems are way more interesting then I thought! Turns out that NASAs "Lead Engineer for Urine Processing" (best title ever, [BBC approves](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150527-solving-a-space-stations-toilet-shaped-problem)) manages to make the average astronaut drink around 730 liters of (recycled) urine and sweat during a mission.

To better profit from the Urine, a special tomatoe plant [has been bred and will be automatically planted in a sattelite](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170308-why-a-german-lab-is-growing-tomatoes-in-urine). Even thought "The walls are lined with grey plastic drain pipes, attached to plastic boxes full of bubbling artificial urine." won't win any poetry-prize, the thought of a sattelite full of little tomatoe plants has a romantic touch.

As sending stuff to space is expensive, there is a lab in antarctica producing vegetables for the researchers there in  [what seems to be a closed system](https://www.livescience.com/62241-antarctica-veggie-harvest.html). They are producing an astounding 5kg per week in their cargo-container-sized greenhouse. They also produce [videos of them doing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zuyvTQfo5w), but only in german.
