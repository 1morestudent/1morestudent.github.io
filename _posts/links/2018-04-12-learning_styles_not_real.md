Learning styles (where visual learners learn better from graphs etc.) are [probably not real](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/). I had no time to look into the underlying studies yet, but this might be one more of the well known psychological phenomenons falling prey to the reproduction crisis. Though, I wonder to what degree such artificial and latent constructs as "learning styles" could ever be considered "real", even if they happen to correlate with some test scores.
