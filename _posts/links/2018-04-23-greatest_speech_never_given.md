William Safire wrote a [speech for Nixon](http://watergate.info/1969/07/20/an-undelivered-nixon-speech.html), in case that Neil Armstrong Edwin Aldrin stranded on the moon. It was published in 1999 and has since been dubbed the "greatest speech never given". Reading such material, I always wonder how it must have felt to live through the race to space. The best glimpse I got into what it might have been linke was (surprisingly) a [music album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyLwfrDyjc) by public service broadcasting.
