A new try to reconstruct neanderthals brains shows that they got [smaller cerebellums and larger occipital lobes](https://phys.org/news/2018-04-size-ancestors-brains-outlast-neanderthals.html) compared to modern humans. 

There is two interesting things about this: first, it looks as thought they calculated their own standard brain with the help of 1000 MRI scans. I wonder whether this is true and why they did so. There are already [standard brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_mapping#Current_Atlas_tools) like the [MNI-brains](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?p=1241) that are widely used in neuroscientific research. Using another brain template hinders the comparability and is usually discouraged. 

One the funnier side, the article above goes into what the cerebellum is used for: "[the cerebellum is] associated with speech comprehension and production, working memory and cognitive flexibility, said Naomichi Ogihara, a mechanical enginee [...]  who worked on the study." - I do not wonder the slightest that they had to ask a mechanical engineer to get such a broken down view on "what the cerebellum is used for". The currently dominant picture in the neurosciences is that most brain regions are recruited for a truck load of different tasks and that the so called "localisationalism" is outdated.
