[Melting Asphalt](http://meltingasphalt.com/), a great blog with mostly philosophically-ish essays, links to an interesting [blog post by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) on the topic of identity. Its main premise is, that people are really bad in discussing things they identify with, so you should let as few things as possible be part of your identity.
