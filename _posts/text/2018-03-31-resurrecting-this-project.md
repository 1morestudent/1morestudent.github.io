After what feels like an eternity (especially considering some throughout changes in my personal life) I want to restart working on this blog.  
  
I thought quite a bit about what I aim for with this blog. I want (/need) to practice writing in english for what I hope will be a joyfull career in science. To do this, I just *need to write stuff*. Thus, I hope to reach my aim of working on content for this blog for at least three hours a week. I am not planning on elongated essays to be the main dish this blog serves, so it might result in around 1.5 posts per week. I already got ideas for ~2.5 (one of them really short) which might motivate me.

About the actual content: I hope to get a healthy mix of the following:

- **Neuropsychology for non-psychos**. I want to try to condense popular, novel or interesting new papers into short overviews that are easily readable for non-scientist, while also giving background information on specific topics. This is in no way a new format, but I feel like science journalism lacks credibility in many cases. So tipping the scales in favour of grounded and thoughtful reports might be good thing.

- **links**. Links to interesting stuff that I stumbled upon while scuttling through the depths of the internet.

- **Thoughts and Stuff**. Things I genuinly thought of myself. Maybe not the most thoughtful or knowledge-expanding things. But, hey, that's what the internet is for: Giving nerds a platform to promulgate their weird theories, so that the real world does not have to hear them babbling all the time.
