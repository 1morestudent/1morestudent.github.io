I just managed to add a major new feature: I can now differentiate multiple types of posts. This mainly happens in the background. What this means on the front end is, that you have a little "links" Button on the upper right hand side now. Clicking it will bring you to a list of links I found over the time, sorted chronologically. I already added one, but more are likely to follow as I sort through my old bookmarks and decide on what is worth sharing.

Collections of links can be found all over the web, and one motivation for me to get this blog running was that it would allow me to have a sort of extended bookmark function. I often caught myself resending the same link to ~10 different contacts of mine or searching for hours for "that one interesting link" I saw 2 years ago. The link section will help me with both, I hope. 

I did not want to integrate it in the main blog, as it would not really fit with its overall style. I would like the hypothetical stranger that happens to find my blog to be able to directly start reading, as soon as they discover it. Extended link-postings in between of the real posts would break the flow. Also, my main role models for blogging, [slatestarcodex](slatestarcodex.com) and [1boringoldman](1boringoldman.com), handle it this way. And what better way is there to attract new readers and find a unique role, then to thoroughly copy other bloggers people?

There will hopefully be an in-depth guide on how to blog with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (the software this all is build upon). It should also feature how I managed to get that link-thingy working. Until then, I will cite [garron.me](https://www.garron.me/en/blog/multi-blog-site-jekyll.html) with one of the most helpful posts about the usage of jekyll that I read so far. Thank you, garron :-)
