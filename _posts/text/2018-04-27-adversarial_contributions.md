*[Epistemic status: quickly thought and written up on my couch. Just some thoughts]*

Slatestarcodex [calls out](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/26/call-for-adversarial-collaborations/) for more [adversarial collaborations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_collaboration). Adversarial collaborations are basically two people with opposing opinions writing a collaborative text on that subject. The idea behind it is, obviously, that you would get a well informed view on both pro and contra arguments.

I am definitely in favour of well informed views, but I am really curious about how well these collaborations work out. In my own field (neuropsychology), views tend to be a bit dogmatic at times. Also, disagreements on a certain subject are almost always founded in disagreement over methods (Own experience. No sources. Treat with caution. Sorry.). These methodological disagreements can, most of the time, not be discussed in depth, because there is a huge pool of methods, and while everyone knows about "their own" methods, only the dim outlines of most others are known. 

The neurosciences are a field where studies are done on humans, and others mammals, and [fish](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039217/), and [leeches](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278399/), and [sea slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplysia#Operant_conditioning); Where data is obtained [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_clamp) or [less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography) or [even less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) or [the least](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) directly (or [not at all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience)); Where you basically finish your PhD without knowing more than one technique to obtain data, and about one fifth of the ways you can analyse what you obtained. The problem is, that all theses methods are needed and sometimes give contradicting informations that can't be simply dissolved, because no one is around knowing both methodologies in depth. 

I think that adversarial collaborations can be a helpful tool in giving a clearer picture *inside* of a single well defined question (e.g. "How should you design an experiment to see whether rats will [voluntarily administer themselves cocaine](http://drugmonkey.scientopia.org/2014/07/08/the-most-replicated-finding-in-drug-abuse-science/)?"). By tying up loose ends and thus condensing the information, we might get to a point where somebody with a background in another subfield can get an indepth understanding of more than their own research topic. But as long as peoples backgrounds are too different, they most likely won't be able to even understand each other, let alone to write an article together.
