Things are now on the front page again! After extensive research (sample size = 1), our highly trained team of designers found that it is unintuitive to have the links hidden away too well. So they appear here now. Like everything else. Yay! \o/ 

The seperate categories on the upper right hand side will continue to exist and link to either only the links or only the texts.

Besides that, I added a "reading" category for books etc. I read / am planing to read. I hope this will motivate me to both read and write a bit more. I am timid in my expectations thought, seeing how my last effort to write more has played out...
