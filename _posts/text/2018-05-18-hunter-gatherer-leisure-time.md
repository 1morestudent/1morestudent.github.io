In his recent [point for universal basic income and against universal basic jobs](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/), Scott Alexander linked to [an interesting and easy to read](http://www.rewild.com/in-depth/leisure.html) essay on the amount of leisure time of hunter-gather sociecties, written bei Jason Godesky. If you have the time (around 10 minutes maybe) please go [over there](http://www.rewild.com/in-depth/leisure.html) and get your own opinion on it ;-)

The article starts off with the bold claim, that *"hunter-gatherers actually have far more leisure time than farmers do, and more still than modern people in the industrialized world."* It mainly states that hunter gatherers work way less then we do in our settled agricultural society, arriving at estimates of ~3 to 5 hours per day. A few calculations follow and the article concludes:

> [taking into account] food preparation, cooking, cleaning, and making, cleaning, and preparing utensils, tools, and so on [...]  we get 55.1 hours for women and 49.5 hours for men [in our society], and if we compare these to the adjusted figures for the !Kung [ [a hunter-gatherer tribe in Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people) ], we see that !Kung women work 72.7% what women in the United States work, while !Kung men work 89.9% what men in the United States work.

I never even thought about things like the leisure time of hunter-gatherer societies (although I find the Idea of living like that really compelling from time to time), but I have to criticize the argument that Godesky makes in a few points.

**I)** What exactly is meant by "making, cleaning, and preparing utensils, tools, and so on"? Where do the adjusted work hours come from? While the article itself is well cited, there does not seem to be a specific source for these numbers. I did not look into the underlying literature (yet).

In our society, we outsourced *a lot* of things to other people. Things like house building, clothes making, child rearing and education (partially), caring for the elderly, conveying messages, finding out about new medicine, mapping, telling tales, preserving our history... The studies on the !Kungs measured working hours as "being away from the village". If the adjusted working hours do not account for all of the above, I am not really okay with calling the rest of their time "leisure time". Sure, there might be some villagers enjoying weaving or teaching or caring for the ill. But even if I do, for example, enjoy repairing my bike, I would not count it as leisure time. 

**II)** Leisure time does not equal leisure time. When I wait for 2 hours at the doctors office, that is sure no working time. Depending on the definition, you may count it as leisure time. Of course, I do not have all the distractions at hand that I would have at home. I am also bound to the place, so I can not visit a theater or a bar or the cinema. But then again, I am also not free to do these things while living in a hunter-gatherer society. Considering the broad spectrum of entertainment, culture, newspapers and distractions in general available to most of us, it is surprising that we only need to work 15 to 40 percent more then the !Kung. I am really undecided whether I would favor less leisure time with more diverse occupations or more leisure without them. But I think it needs at least mentioning where quite a lot of our working hour plus goes.


**Conculsion:** I don't want to criticize Godeskys general point in favor of a hunter-gatherer life: a lot of his points still hold. E.g. the "work" of hunter-gatherers seems more enjoyable then that of most people in our society. Do you want to pick berries or stand at an assembly line? At least for me that is hardly a question. I just think that his try at calculating working hours is a bit to reductionist and he is missing a clear definition of leisure time. It seems to me like the concept of leisure time vs. working time might not be as clear cut in hunter-gatherer societies compared to ours.
