I try to keep a fairly regular journaling schedule since I started to really wonder about mortality - I was around 13 years old at the time. While grasping the fact that there will be an end one day, I started to think about preserving my thoughts. The changes one undergoes during puberty showed that views can quickly alternate, and that past states of mind are [hard to remember](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103197913330). Despite this grave background, I utterly failed at keeping to any schedule, sometimes not writing anything for a year or two.

I am still not good at writing in my journal, sometimes passing 3 months without writing a single word. Currently, I try to write at least a few lines every day - a project I am currently 5 days behind on. So why beginning this series of posts instead of getting back to it right now? 

- I recently stumbled over a few references to journaling in different media I consumed.
- It is a thing I keep thinking about.
- I might get some motivation to actually keeping up to writing.
- Procrastination is always fun!



In the beginning of the published correspondence between [Astrid Lindgren]() and [Louise Hartung](), the former writes:

> I read truly strange things. 'Arstafruns dagbok' - that most likely doesn't ring a bell for you. In the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, there was a [...] lady of the manor. She wrote in her personal diary all her live. Ultimately only a few lines per day, but she was certainly a fiend, but a proficient fiend, and from her dry notes emerges a live. [...] Sometimes, I am truly sad, that so many humans, infinitely many humans, lived on our earth and died, without leaving any traces, nothing at all, that, to us, that we are living now, would proclaim: I have lived too! 

The [book](https://www.amazon.de/Ich-habe-auch-gelebt-Freundschaft/dp/3548289843/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1528146068&sr=1-1&keywords=Astrid+Lindgren+louise+Hartung) sadly seems to be publised only in german and not in english, thought a short albeit shallow english review can be [found here](http://abeautifulhue.blogspot.com/2017/01/books-letters-between-astrid-lindgren.html).

Writing, and maybe especially journaling, offers a certain degree of "immortality". In his book ["Staring at the Sun"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2062034.Staring_at_the_Sun), the psychiatrist and therapist [Irvin D. Yalom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvin_D._Yalom#Publications) writes about ways to face the fear of death. The book profoundly moved me at the time I read it and I really want to get around to re-read it and write a review of it here. One of his core ideas is what he calls a ripple effect (or something akin - I only got the German version at hand). He explains it as follows (again losely translated from the German version): 

> "[...] the believe to persist not as an individual entity, but to continue to have an influence on future generations through values and actions can be a great solace for someone  anxious about their own mortality."

I think, as Astrid Lindgren does, that journaling and writing in general can increase the subjective amount of transfer going from oneself to others. While talking and living with others ensures that at least some part of ones personality gets carried over, our thoughts are pretty limited in their reach - as long as we don't express them in a more permanent form then the usual kitchen discussions during house parties. I am always awed by the fact that *behind every face I see on the streets lies a profound backstory, a full person with their own thoughts, motivations, fears, dreams and aspirations*. Reading someones Journals or letters does not only help to understand other peoples motives and thought, but also to realize that those people were alive one day. 

Now, the average gal or guy from next door might not get the readership that Astrid Lindgrens different writings get. But there are, at least annecdotically, counter examples. My grandmother is currently writing her memoires with a few of her friends. They do it mainly to pass them over to my fathers generation. But while she was at it, my grandmother remembered an old journal that *her* mother kept, gathered it from somewhere on the attic, deciphered her handwriting (a task I would not have been able to do. Old german handwriting can be really different from the more modern "fonts" used today) and thus helped to carry the thoughts of my great grandmother during her 20s and 30s to me today, almost a century later. As I remember it, the Idea of Yaloms "ripple effect" is, that the influence might get weaker and less direct as the generations pass, but that it also gets more distributed, in way that the total influence stays more or less constant. My great grandmother sort of bipassed this effect by writing her diary and is still influencing in a surprisingly direct way todays generation, almost 100 years later.
